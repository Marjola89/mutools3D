\usage{
clusterExt(X, Y, extract, A, NNmatrix, nPermutations = 1000, HC4m = FALSE,
  parallel = FALSE, nCores = 1, thrFirst = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{is the design matrix. Number of rows = number of subjects in the study, number of columns = number of vertices in the atlas. Numerical varable must be normalized to 0-mean and unit-standard deviation. Categorical variables must be coded using dummy coding. The first column should contain the intercept (all 1s).}

\item{Y}{is the imaging matrix. Number of rows = N. Number of columns = V.}

\item{extract}{is an array expressing which covariates in X you want to extract.}

\item{A}{A V-dimensional vector containing the area associated with a vertex, usually its Voronoi area.}

\item{NNmatrix}{Nx2 matrix containing the mesh edges. Important: to speed up the execution please avoid repetitions like (A,B) and (B,A).}

\item{nPermutations}{number of permutations in the permutation test, default is 1000.}

\item{HC4m}{flag for triggering HC4m correction, default is FALSE.}

\item{parallel}{flag for triggering parallel computing, default is FALSE.}

\item{nCores}{flag for defining the number of cores to use, default is 1.}

\item{firsThr}{the cluster-forming threshold.}
}
\value{
The output of this function contains a list of the vertices that reached significace, 0 otherwise.
}
\description{
Given a NxV imaging matrix Y (N = number of subjects, V = number of vertices in the ventricular mesh), a NxC model matrix X  (N = number of subjects, C = number of variables + intercept term) 
and the number of the column variables to extract, this function computes whether a vertex belongs to a significant cluster or not using a cluster-extend based thresholding method. 
The output is an array which stores as 1 the vertices that reached significance, 0 otherwise.
