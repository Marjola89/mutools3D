\title{Compute nearest neighbour matrix for TFCE.}
\usage{
computeNNmatrix(triangles)
}
\arguments{
\item{triangles}{a Tx3 matrix (T = number of triangles in the triangular mesh) containing vertices IDs of each triangle.}
}
\value{
A Ex2 matrix containing the mesh edges (E = numbr of edges)
}
\description{
Given a Tx3 matrix (T = number of triangles in the triangular mesh) containing vertices IDs of each triangle, this function computes a Ex2 matrix containing the mesh edges (E = numbr of edges).
To each mesh corresponds a unique NNmatrix, which is exploited by TFCE function to compute TFCE scores. In order to speed up TFCE execution time, repetitions like (A,B) and (B,A) are avoided.
